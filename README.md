# FourierDehazeNet (Under Consideration)

Official PyTorch implementation of the paper:  
**"FourierDehazeNet: Fourier-Domain Band Decomposition with Multi-Scale Feature Fusion for Remote Sensing Image Dehazing"**

> **Academic Notice**: This paper is currently under consideration at a peer-reviewed conference/journal. To maintain the integrity of the review process, we are providing the model architecture and training code at this stage. The complete dataset and pre-trained weights will be released upon formal acceptance.

**Training Logs Availability**:  
We provide comprehensive training logs for the StateHaze1K dataset's three subsets as evidence of our experimental process:
- `./logs/thin.log` - Training metrics for thin haze conditions
- `./logs/moderate.log` - Training metrics for moderate haze conditions  
- `./logs/thick.log` - Training metrics for thick haze conditions

> *Note: Logs from other experimental runs were unfortunately purged during system maintenance before we could archive them systematically. The provided logs represent the complete and reproducible training processes for our main results.*
